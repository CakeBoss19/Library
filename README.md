# Library
A javascript project as part of The Odin Project's curriculum.   

I will create a library to store information on books.
  Information such as the title, author, number of pages,
  and whether or not you have read the book.

This project will focus primarily on storing objects and 
  the different ways to call back to them to get various bits
  of information. Will include a proper example of prototyping
  through a delete function.

// About a month later, I am thinking it would benefit me greatly
if I came back to refactor my code here. The app is simple, and works
perfectly as it does, but the code is all written in one .js file.

Unorganized.

I aim to gain more skill in code organization by refactoring my previous code
and making it more easy to read. I will try my best not to mess with the functionailty of the code, but lets be real. These functions are thrown around like crazy, so it's gonna take some work.
