# Library
A javascript project as part of The Odin Project's curriculum.   

I will create a library to store information on books.
  Information such as the title, author, number of pages,
  and whether or not you have read the book.

This project will focus primarily on storing objects and 
  the different ways to call back to them to get various bits
  of information. Will include a proper example of prototyping
  through a delete function.
